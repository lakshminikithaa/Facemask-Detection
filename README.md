# Real-Time Face Mask Detection Using Deep Learning
smart system that can automatically detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time video streams using deep learning techniques. 
# Overview
This project leverages transfer learning with MobileNetV2 to build a reliable face mask detection system. By integrating a pre-trained face detector with a custom-trained mask classifier, the system can process video feeds in real time and provide visual feedback on mask usage.
# Features
Detects face masks in real-time from a webcam feed
Uses MobileNetV2 pre-trained on ImageNet for mask classification

Face detection implemented with Caffe-based SSD 

Highlights faces with bounding boxes and confidence scores

Includes training scripts with data augmentation

Generates training performance visualizations4
